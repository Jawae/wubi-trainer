    <h2> What is Wubi? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>五笔字型输入法 (Wǔbǐ zì xíng shūrù fǎ) is a method to type chinese characters on a standard computer keyboard,
            invented by Wang Yongmin.
        </li>
        <li><b> Wubi is a shape-based input method: Chinese Characters are identified by a sequence of character
            components.
        </b> <br/>
            In general each character is identified by four keystrokes, but very common characters require less than
            four
            keystrokes or even have a one letter shortcut.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The advantages of the Wubi method (personal opinion)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can write characters that you don't know the pronunciation and meaning of. (This is something that might
            be
            quite useful for language learners)
        </li>
        <li> Paying more attention to how characters are composed might make it easier to remember and distinguish
            between them.
        </li>
        <li>Typing becomes very automatic and fast: You don't have to select the right character out of a list of
            homophonic characters.
            The chinese characters are uniquely identified by their components and stroke order</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It takes a while to memorize and practice the location of all the character components.
            (you need to build muscle memory so that the typing becomes automatic)
        </li>
        <li> You should already be familiar with how chinese characters are composed in general</li>
        <li>You need a basic knowledge how chinese stroke order works:

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> How to use this app? </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Under "Lessons" select a set of character components to practice</li>
        <li> Then switch to the "Practice" page, click "start typing" and press the key for the prompted character</li>
        <li>

            When learning new character components <b>use ENTER to show the wubi keyboard layout.</b> <br/> You can also
            press
            <b> SPACE to take a quick peek</b>
            where this character component is located on your keyboard and to which group of components it belongs.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2> More tips... </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Practice new character components slowly until you make few errors and know their position on the keyboard
            by heart. Then
            try to speed your typing up.
        </li>
        <li> Start with individual characters sets, then combine several lists and practice them together</li>
        <li> Compare the character components to the other ones on the same key, similar components are grouped
            together
        </li>
        <li> Components with less strokes are located along the keyboard center</li>
        <li> Your progress on each character is stored locally in your browser</li>
